## Many body dynamics

This code contains an erroneous code. Try to use DDT to find the bug.
Use the `archer2.qtf` template submission file to launch an interactive DDT session. There are two versions of the code , one in C and one in Fortran. 

1) Step trough the program.
2) Create a breakpoint in the suboutine computing the forces.
3) Trace the value of the energy during the simulation.
